# # Fast inference with vLLM (Gemma 7B)
#
# In this example, we show how to run basic LLM inference, using [`vLLM`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
# to take advantage of [PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180), which speeds up inference on longer sequences with optimized key-value caching.
# You can read more about PagedAttention [here](https://charlesfrye.github.io/programming/2023/11/10/llms-systems.html).
#
# We'll run the [Gemma 7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it) large language model.
# Gemma is the weights-available version of Google's Gemini model series.
#
# The "7B" in the name refers to the number of parameters (floating point numbers used to control inference)
# in the model. Applying those 7,000,000,000 numbers onto an input is a lot of work,
# so we'll use a GPU to speed up the process -- specifically, a top-of-the-line [NVIDIA H100](https://modal.com/blog/introducing-h100).
#
# "Instruct" means that this version of Gemma is not simply a statistical model of language,
# but has been fine-tuned to follow instructions -- like ChatGPT or Claude,
# it is a model of an assistant that can understand and follow instructions.
#
# You can expect cold starts in under 30 seconds and well over 1000 tokens/second throughput.
# The larger the batch of prompts, the higher the throughput. For example, with the 64 prompts below,
# we can produce nearly 15k tokens with a latency just over 5 seconds, for a throughput of >2.5k tokens/second.
# That's a lot of text!
#
#
# To run
# [any of the other supported models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html),
# just change the model name. You may also need to change engine configuration, like `trust_remote_code`,
# or GPU configuration, in order to run some models.
#
# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

import os
import time

import modal

MODEL_DIR = "/model"
MODEL_NAME = "google/gemma-7b-it"


# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the model weights pre-saved to a directory. The benefit of this
# is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Hugging Face - instead, it will take
# advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
#
# ### Download the weights
# Make sure you have created a [HuggingFace access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
# To access the token in a Modal function, we can create a secret on the [secrets page](https://modal.com/secrets).
# Now the token will be available via the environment variable named `HF_TOKEN`. Functions that inject this secret
# will have access to the environment variable.
#
# We can download the model to a particular directory using the HuggingFace utility function `snapshot_download`.
#
# You may need to accept the license agreement from an account associated with that Hugging Face Token
# to download the model.
def download_model_to_image(model_dir, model_name):
    from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
    from transformers.utils import move_cache

    os.makedirs(model_dir, exist_ok=True)

    snapshot_download(
        model_name,
        local_dir=model_dir,
        token=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
        ignore_patterns=["*.pt", "*.gguf"],  # Using safetensors
    )
    move_cache()


# ### Image definition
# We’ll start from a Docker Hub image by NVIDIA and install `vLLM`.
# Then we’ll use `run_function` to execute `download_model_to_image`
# and save the resulting files to the container image -- that way we don't need
# to redownload the weights every time we change the server's code or start up more instances of the server.

# ## Encapulate the model in a class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) and the `@enter` decorator.
# This enables us to load the model into memory just once every time a container starts up, and keep it cached
# on the GPU for each subsequent invocation of the function.
#
# The `vLLM` library allows the code to remain quite clean!
