# # Stable Diffusion CLI
#
# This example shows Stable Diffusion 1.5 with a number of optimizations
# that makes it run faster on Modal. The example takes about 10s to cold start
# and about 1.0s per image generated.
#
# To use the XL 1.0 model, see the example posted [here](/docs/examples/stable_diffusion_xl).
#
# For instance, here are 9 images produced by the prompt
# `A 1600s oil painting of the New York City skyline`
#
# ![stable diffusion montage](./stable_diffusion_montage.png)
#
# As mentioned, we use a few optimizations to run this faster:
#
# * Use [run_function](/docs/reference/modal.Image#run_function) to download the model while building the container image
# * Use a [container lifecycle method](https://modal.com/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions) to initialize the model on container startup
# * Use A10G GPUs
# * Use 16 bit floating point math


# ## Basic setup
from __future__ import annotations

import io
import time
from pathlib import Path

import modal

# All Modal programs need a [`App`](/docs/reference/modal.App) â€” an object that acts as a recipe for
# the application. Let's give it a friendly name.

app = modal.App("stable-diffusion-cli")

# ## Model dependencies
#
# Your model will be running remotely inside a container. We will be installing
# all the model dependencies in the next step. We will also be "baking the model"
# into the image by running a Python function as a part of building the image.
# This lets us start containers much faster, since all the data that's needed is
# already inside the image.

model_id = "Jiali/stable-diffusion-1.5"

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.10").pip_install(
    "accelerate==0.29.2",
    "diffusers==0.15.1",
    "ftfy==6.2.0",
    "safetensors==0.4.2",
    "torch==2.2.2",
    "torchvision",
    "transformers~=4.25.1",
    "triton~=2.2.0",
    "xformers==0.0.25post1",
)

with image.imports():
    import diffusers
    import torch


# ## Using container lifecycle methods
#
# Modal lets you implement code that runs every time a container starts. This
# can be a huge optimization when you're calling a function multiple times,
# since Modal reuses the same containers when possible.
#
# The way to implement this is to turn the Modal function into a method on a
# class that also has lifecycle methods (decorated with `@enter()` and/or `@exit()`).
#
# We have also have applied a few model optimizations to make the model run
# faster. On an A10G, the model takes about 6.5s to load into memory, and then
# 1.6s per generation on average. On a T4, it takes 13s to load and 3.7s per
# generation. Other optimizations are also available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/fp16#memory-and-speed).

# This is our Modal function. The function runs through the `StableDiffusionPipeline` pipeline.
# It sends the PIL image back to our CLI where we save the resulting image in a local file.

# ## Performance
#
# This example can generate pictures in about a second, with startup time of about 10s for the first picture.
#
# See distribution of latencies below. This data was gathered by running 500 requests in sequence (meaning only
# the first request incurs a cold start). As you can see, the 90th percentile is 1.2s and the 99th percentile is 2.30s.
